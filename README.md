## The Origin Story

```
> Day 1: Wrote a batch script to automate a boring IT task
> Day 2: "Wait... I can make computers do things FOR me?"
> Day 1000+: Still chasing that same high
```

Five years ago, I was doing IT support and wrote a simple batch script. That tiny automation sparked something. YouTube became my classroom, curiosity became my curriculum, and now I build web apps that actually ship.

I've grown with a startup from a 2-person dev team to 5, wearing hats I didn't know existed. Remote work? Just how I operate now. Async communication is second nature.

**The Interesting Stuff**
```
├── Puppeteer (web automation)
├── Electron (desktop apps)
├── Chrome Extensions
├── Google Apps Script
├── RabbitMQ / Stripe / Twilio
└── Sentry (because bugs happen)
```

## Currently Exploring 

```
├── Mastra AI SDK (building AI agents)
├── Vercel AI SDK
├── Google AI ADK
├── Open Router
└── Docker (containerizing my chaos)
```

The AI tooling space moves fast. I'm keeping up.

## Things I've Actually Built

| Project | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Resume Builder** | Because I got tired of fighting with Word |
| **Mindly** | AI powered second memory for humans who forget things (me) |
| **Real Estate Site** | Built for my dad and his friends and family tech support evolved |
| **Invoice Generator** | Freelancing meant I needed to get paid properly |
| **Various Client MVPs** | Turning ideas into working products, fast |

## My Take on AI (After Actually Using It)

When I started with Stable Diffusion/chatGPT back at launch, I thought AI would write everything for me. One prompt, done. 

**Reality check:** Even Opus models are like brilliant junior devs who can't quite see the full picture yet.

My workflow evolution tells the story:
```
ChatGPT UI → Cursor → Claude Code → Whatever comes next
```

AI is a 10x multiplier, not a replacement. It helps me learn faster, iterate quicker, and build more but the architecture, the real problem solving? That's still on us.

*It's a fantastic time to build things.*
